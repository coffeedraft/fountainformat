        <pre>INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Rain streaks the window. ANNA (30s, tired) sits alone, 
stirring a cold coffee. The door CHIMES.

MARCUS (40s, disheveled) spots her. Hesitates. Walks over.

MARCUS
This seat taken?

ANNA
(without looking up)
It's a free country.

He sits. Long silence.

MARCUS
I got your message.

ANNA
Which one? I sent twelve.

MARCUS
(beat)
All of them.</pre>

SARAH sprints across the gravel. Behind her, FOOTSTEPS.

She reaches the edge. Looks down. **Ten stories.**

SARAH
(to herself)
Don't think. Just jump.

She backs up. Runs. LEAPS--

CUT TO:

EXT. ADJACENT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

Sarah CRASHES onto the next building, rolls, keeps running.

PURSUER (O.S.)
You can't run forever!

SARAH
(over her shoulder)
Watch me.

I never want to see you again!

I'm sorry, I love you!

Silence. Neither moves.

EMMA

Then why did you leave?

(quietly)
I was afraid.</pre>

DOCTOR
I'm afraid the news isn't good.

[[NOTE: Consider making this a single shot, 
no cuts, to build tension.]]

PATIENT
How long?

DOCTOR
(hesitates)
Six months. Maybe less.

/*
ALTERNATE VERSION - MORE HOPEFUL:

DOCTOR
There's a new treatment. Experimental.
It's risky, but...

PATIENT
But there's a chance?

DOCTOR
There's always a chance.

Credit: Written by
Author: Your Name
Draft date: 2025

FADE IN:

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

ELEANOR (80s) sits at a small table. Sunlight through 
lace curtains. A cup of tea, untouched. 

An ENVELOPE in her hands. Yellowed. Old.

She traces the handwriting on the front. Smiles.

ELEANOR (V.O.)
Sixty years. I kept it sixty years.

She opens it. Carefully. Like it might crumble.

INSERT - THE LETTER

Handwritten. Faded blue ink.

"My darling Eleanor, If you're reading 
this, I didn't make it home..."

BACK TO SCENE

A tear rolls down her cheek. She's still smiling.

ELEANOR
(whispers)
I never stopped waiting, Henry.

She folds the letter. Places it against her heart.

ELEANOR (V.O.)
Some letters you read once and throw 
away. Others you carry forever.

She looks out the window. The sun catches her eyes.

ELEANOR
I'll see you soon.

FADE TO WHITE.
